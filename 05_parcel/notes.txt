main budlers :
1.parcel: simple and easy to use
2.vite  optimised buildf framework

export default{
    key:value,
    ...

}

import React from 'reat' this gives error as browser cant understand the node moduels so we use dev tools parcel to solve this issue.
node modules are meant to serve the server 
//steps
1.npx parcel <file name>  index.html
2.it generate a dist folder in which we have index.html ,and two index.....js basically two files for source mapping and js code like the way babel used to do

we can observe that the code in dist/index.js  hasw react code and 

Parcel features:
hot reloading with addede  code initiallly if any changes browwser reload all file but later it support hotrea
this hot module replacement make changes in .js withoput reloading 

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept();
}


by changing entry point in package.json  we can build the project whhich gives all the htmla and index.js i dist folder in minified format for production
